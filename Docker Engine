Docker CLI [Interacts with REST api internally to do the operations] --> REST API [Interacts with docker engine to create images, containers etc..,] 
--> Docker Engine [Maintains daemons, containers, images etc..,] 

Docker uses Namespaces to run the services as containers in the host and provide isolation between containers.

eg:- process_id PID namespace

Linux boots up with the PID of 1. PID=1 is the root process and all the child processes run under it. 
Two processes cannot have the same PID. 

But to differentiate 2 containers, each container will have a PID of 1. This containerization is achieved by namespace.
eg:- PID 5 in main host is mapped to PID 1 in container
     PID 6 in main host is mapped to PID 2 in container which is a child process inside container

Linux:
PID 1 --> 2 3 4 5 6
PID 5 --> Container
PID 6 --> child process inside container

How container can see?
PID1 -> Parent [mapped to pid 5 of linux host]
PID2 --> child [mapped to pid 6 of linux host]
      

To restrict the docker from utilizing the features from the main host, we can run docker commands as below

docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu
docker run --memory=.5 ubuntu
